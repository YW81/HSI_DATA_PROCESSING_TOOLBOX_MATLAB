# Unsupervised Hyperspectral Target Detection
One of major strengths resulting from hyperspectral imaging is the ability to find subtle targets of
interest such as subpixel targets, anomalies that cannot be resolved by multispectral imaging. However,
it also comes with an issue of how to find them, since such targets are generally not visualized
by inspection and must be found in an unsupervised manner without prior knowledge. This part
extends the three supervised LSMA-based techniques, OSP/LSOSP, NCLS, and FCLS, to their
unsupervised counterparts, automatic target generation process (ATGP), unsupervised NCLS
(UNCLS), and unsupervised FCLS (UFCLS)
