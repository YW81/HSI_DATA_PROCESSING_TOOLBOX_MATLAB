# Constrained Band Selection
DR and band selection (BS) have been widely used for data compression. MATLAB codes of several
component analysis-based DR techniques have been provided in Section A.3. This section
presents a new approach to BS, called constrained band selection (CBS), which is based on the
constrained energy minimization (CEM) developed for target detection in Chapter 2.
