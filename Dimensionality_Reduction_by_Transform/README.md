# Dimensionality Reduction by Transform

Here four transformations are used to perform data dimensionality reduction (DR). 

Two are of second-order
statistics-based transformations, data variance-based principal components analysis (PCA),
and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-based maximum noise fraction (MNF). 

The other two are of high-order
statistics (HOS)-based transformations, independent component analysis (ICA), and high-order
statistical moment-based transforms. 

Details of these four DR transformations can be found
in Chapter 6 of the "Hyperspectral Data Processing: Algorithm Design and Analysis" book.
