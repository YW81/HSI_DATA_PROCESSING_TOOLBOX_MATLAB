# Estimation of Virtual Dimensionality

The concept of virtual dimensionality (VD) was first coined in the book by Chien-I Chang (2003a) and
later published by Chang and Du (2004). It is defined as the number of spectrally distinct signatures
present in the data and has received considerable interest in unsupervised hyperspectral data
exploitation since it was introduced in 2003. Many approaches have been developed for estimating
the value of Virtual dimensionality or VD. 

Nevertheless, the most popular algorithm to be used for this purpose is the one
developed by Harsanyi et al. (1994a), whose idea was the origin of VD. All the details of VD along
with techniques developed to estimate VD can be found in Chapter 5 of Chien-I Chang's book "Hyperspectral Data Processing: Algorithm Design and Analysis"
